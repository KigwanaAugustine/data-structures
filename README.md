# Java Data Structures Project

## Introduction

This project is a collection of Java classes and interfaces representing a variety of data structures. It serves as a learning resource and reference for implementing and understanding data structures and algorithms in Java.

## Data Structures Included

(List the data structures you're planning to implement, e.g., LinkedList, BinaryTree, HashMap, etc.)

- LinkedList
- BinaryTree
- Stack
- Queue
- HashMap

## Algorithms Included

(If you are including algorithms as well, list them here.)

- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or above.
- Any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Setup

Describe the steps to set up the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd data-structures

# Compile the code (give an example if needed, or direct to a build script)
javac -d bin src/**/*.java
